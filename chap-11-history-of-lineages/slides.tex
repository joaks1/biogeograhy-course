% what is phylogenetics
% why phylogenetics is important
%     nothing in biology dob quote
%     Seen in the light of evolution, biology is, perhaps, intellectually the
%     most satisfying and inspiring science. Without that light it becomes a pile
%     of sundry facts some of them interesting or curious but making no
%     meaningful picture as a whole.
%     Dobzhansky, T. (1973). Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. The American Biology Teacher 35:125--129.
%     ... nothing in evolution makes sense except in the light of phylogeny... SSB (http://systbio.org/teachevolution.html)
%     impossible to understand biodiversity without framework
%     biogeog
%         ecological biogeog -- independent contrast stuff
%         understanding diversification across space and time

% Classification before phylogeny -- been classifying stuff since hg days -> tends to form hiearchies
% Linneaus formalized this
% Evolution gave the framework behind why hiearchies were intuitive

% Tree anatomy stuff
    % branches tips nodes etc
    % monophyly poly para etc.
    % branch rotation

% History -- three schools
    % Evol systematics
        % key point: very subjective and recognized paraphyletic groups
        % was very popular and legacy remains... many paraphyletic groups (fish, reptiles)
    
    % Numerical phenetics/taxonomy
        % sought objective, quantitative methods.
        % quantitiative clustering algorithms cluster taxa based on similarity of phenotypic traits.
        % resulted in paraphyletic/polyphyletic groups due to similarity among convergence
        % math / algorithms produced are still very useful for multivariate stats

    % Phylogenetic systematics / Cladistics
        % hennigian logic (mth lec 4)
        % logical inference: premises -> rules -> statement
        % premise: we can code characters
        % taxa that share a character state must be more closely related

    % homology (shared due to no change) / homoplasy ("same change" has more than once; shared due to changes)
        % homologous
            % plesio / apo  morphy
            % synapo /symplesio
        

% Methods
    % not going to dwell on Hennig... important then... not so much now.
    % Current methods are statistical (model-based).

% Molecular evolution

% Phylogeography
